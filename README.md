# My name is Federico | Junior Android Developer üë®‚Äçüíª </br> Welcome to my Code! </br> ![](https://visitor-badge.laobi.icu/badge?page_id=MenneaDb.MenneaDb) [![Github](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/MenneaDb?label=Followers&logo=Github)](https://github.com/MenneaDb)

### **About me**

I am a Junior Android developer based in Amsterdam. I came into coding to change my professional perspective and refine my attitude in looking for a creative solution in relation to a problem, without taking away the fact of being able to build up a program from scratch and being capable of giving vent to the desire to improve and constantly find new useful solutions to accomplish.  

As my leading language, I chose to focus on Kotlin because it is an intuitive and clean programming language that aspires to simplify the code and its execution, something in which I completely mirror myself.
